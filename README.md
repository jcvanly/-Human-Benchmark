This project is called Human Benchmark and it is based off of this website with the same name. The program will ask for a user name and then bring you to a home screen with 9 buttons allowing you to play 9 different mini games. These games are all implemented in Javafx and they test the user in various aspects. After playing each game, the user can save his score to a CSV to view later. Below you can see how the various classes interact with each other.

To use the program, you simply run the main class and that will launch everything. From there enter a user name and you will be taken to the home screen where you can choose one of nine games. Each game will allow you to save your scores in a CSV file. 

Currently chimp test is the only game with a major bug. I cannot figure out how to get buttons to remain in the same place after you click a button and remove them. Other than that, the logic works fine.
