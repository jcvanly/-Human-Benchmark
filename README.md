This project is called Human Benchmark and it is based off of this website with the same name. The program will ask for a user name and then bring you to a home screen with 9 buttons allowing you to play 9 different mini games. These games are all implemented in Javafx and they test the user in various aspects. After playing each game, the user can save his score to a CSV to view later. Below you can see how the various classes interact with each other.
